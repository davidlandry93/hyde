Repeatedly I am told the the hardest part of a master's is the redaction.
Knowing that it seems like a good idea to begin writing as soon as possible. My
objective for this blog is to relate my work from a technical point of view, in
a way that should help writing my thesis in the end. I will also try to describe
my experience as a student, with its ups and downs.

Hopefully this can be useful to someone else as well.
