In this paper we explore the properties of a topometric map created for _Teach
and Repeat_. 

When building maps in that context, the environment is often sampled uniformly,
even though some areas make it more difficult to localize than others. We
develop a way to be smarter about the nodes of our map, such that we are more
careful in places where it is hard to localize, and we are less cautious in
areas that are easy.
