I am David Landry. I currently work at [Laval University](http://ulaval.ca) as a
master's student in mobile robotics. I am under the supervision of
[Philippe Gigu√®re](http://www2.ift.ulaval.ca/~pgiguere/). My interests include 
navigation in complex environments, mainly using the _Teach and Repeat_ paradigm.
I also enjoy movies and [fika](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fika_(Sweden)).
